Note that these examples all assume an HD 16:9 viewport. To record an entire viewport with a
different resolution, you'll need to actually supply that viewport's resolution. For example, for
a 4K 16:9 viewport, the required resolution would be 3840x2160.

To take a screenshot screen.png:
```bash
ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size 1920x1080 -i $DISPLAY -vframes 1 screen.png
```
where -video_size specifies the size of the area to capture.

To take a screencast screen.mkv with lossless encoding and without audio:
```bash
ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size 1920x1080 -framerate 25 -i $DISPLAY -c:v ffvhuff screen.mkv
```

To take a screencast screen.mp4 with lossy encoding and with audio.
```bash
ffmpeg -f x11grab -video_size 1920x1080 -framerate 25 -i $DISPLAY -f alsa -i default -c:v libx264 -preset ultrafast -c:a aac screen.mp4
```
