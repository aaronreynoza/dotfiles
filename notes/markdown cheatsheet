# Github automatically parses anchor tags out of your headers. So you can do the following:

Markdown:
---
[Custom foo description](#foo)
# Foo
---

# In the above case, the Foo header has generated an anchor tag with the name foo
# Note: just one # for all heading sizes, no space between # and anchor name, anchor tag names must be lowercase, and delimited by dashes if multi-word.
