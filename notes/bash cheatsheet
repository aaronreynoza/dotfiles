# Get the directory containing the script being executed
# From: https://stackoverflow.com/a/246128:
# It will work as long as the last component of the path used to find the script is not a symlink
# (directory links are OK). If you also want to resolve any links to the script itself, you need a
# multi-line solution:
DIR="$( cd "$( dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" )" >/dev/null 2>&1 && pwd )"
